This implemented a multi-layer perceptron(MLP) to classiffy images.
The MLP is made of 4 fully connected layers.
Layer configuration is 200-128-128-128.
The training images of the same class should be basicly similar in view.
This MLP may be able to adapt to lightning variation and some outliers (non-scene objects).

A pretrained weight is prepared.
However, a new classification task with different images require addtional training or re-train.

To prepare the training data, put images of the same class into a directory under /train.
To prepare the testing data, likewise, put images of the same class into a directory under /test.
Modifying the path to training and testing directory enables running different training/testing.

The program will automatically traverse images in different class (label) directories.
All image will be loaded into memory.
Some computers may encounter â€œmemory error" due to excessive memory usage.
(This should be modified for more efficient memory usage)
